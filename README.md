# MasaAuthenticator

This is a [Masa CMS](http://www.masacms.com/) Module for implementing [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). 

It was orgininaly developed as a Mura module by [Steve Withington](https://github.com/stevewithington) and forked by We Are Orange BV as a Masa CMS module.

## Setup Instructions
* Drop this module into a valid `modules` directory. For example, `{MasaRoot}/modules/MasaAuthenticator`
* In the `/config/settings.ini.cfm` file, set `mfa=true` and reload Masa CMS
* The next time a user attempts to log in, they will be prompted with instructions on what to do next.

## Important Notes
* Once enabled, Masa CMS users *must* install an authentication app such as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) (recommended), Google Authenticator ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)), or Microsoft Authenticator ([Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/authenticator-for-windows/9nblggh4n8mx), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en), or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)).
* If a user loses their authentication device, and does not have access to any of their pre-generated backup codes, they will be required to contact the site administrator.

### Minimum Requirements
* [Masa CMS](http://www.masacms.com/) v7.1+
* [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/coldfusion) 2016+ or [Lucee](http://lucee.org/) 5.0+
